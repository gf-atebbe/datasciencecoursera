To run this code you must have the dataset for the project in the same working directory as run_analysis.R.

You should be able to run the script just by sourcing it in an R session.

The script follows the five objectives for this assignment and they are completed in sequential order.

From the assignment description it was not clear if we are supposed to remove columns where all of the values are NA.  Its also unclear how the output file should be formatted, so I put each measurement type as a row and the columns are all combinations of subject and activity. Its also unclear if the tidy data set should only include the standard deviation and mean columns from Stewp #2 so I included all of them.

I found the instructions for this assignment to be rather vague and poorly worded so good luck assessing this :)
